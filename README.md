# practice_logging
[Practice] This project is just practice to acquaint myself with git/github and to refresh my python logging skills.

This repository was created to practice git/github and to brush up on my python logging skills.  It will most likely be a very low volume repo with very few pulls/pushes.  And the code will be very elementary and not of any value.
